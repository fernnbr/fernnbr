## Hi there, I'm Sarah F. Fernn, and... | (she || her) | ( [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/followers/fernnbr?label=follow&style=social)](https://github.com/fernnbr) / ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=fernnbr&color=006bed) )

🔹 ...My nick is Shuri 

💼 I'm the founder & CEO @ Stardust Zone, working for neurodivergent inclusion and prosperity amongst societies

📚 Also I'm studying Software Engineering @ École 42, in addition to my Public and Private management background

🔍 Currently I'm exploring DevOps | A.I. for Good | Software Architecture and working in Deeptech and CivicTech projects  

😄 ... And engaged in: CivicTech | SocialTech | DeepTech, because I believe technology should empower people, foster inclusion, and be a force for systemic change especially for those historically left on the margins 

🛠️ Continuosly Learning: C | Python | Akoma Ntoso | LexML | LEOS, that nowadays help me to build inclusive digital legal frameworks, develop civic-minded tools, and contribute to open, interoperable systems that serve real social impact

🛠️ And Also: Neural Networks | NLP | ML, because understanding how machines process language and patterns enables me to design intelligent systems that amplify human potential and create more adaptive technologies for diverse minds

> My mission is to engineer a future where #tech doesn't just include the unheard, it amplifies their voices and talents
